Set any colour as your system accent! The app gets your choice of colours (along with a name) and creates an overlay targeting android (framework-res). A Magisk module is created by the app, which injects the created overlay to the system.

**Features**

* You can select colours from your wallpaper, presets in the app or set your own custom colour.
* Multiple accents can be created.
* Separate accents for dark & light theme [Android 10 only].
* Adjust Hue, saturation & lightness of the chosen colours to your liking. Android 10 users can use this to create desaturated dark theme accent.
* Enable/disable accents.
* Remove created accents (swipe from the sides).

**Requirements**

* Android 8+
* Magisk
