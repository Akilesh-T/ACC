**Custom accent colour creator for Android 10**

Set any colour as your system accent! The app gets your choice of colours (along with a name) and creates an overlay targeting android (framework-res). A Magisk module is created by the app, which injects the created overlay to the system.

**Requirements**

* Android 10
* Magisk
